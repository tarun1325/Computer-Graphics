This assignment gave me a good understanding of the 2D Graphics and interpolating points.

- By this Code, you can Draw Lagrange and Beizer Curve for any no. of points.
- Zoom In and Zoom out Function is also provided.
- Rotation around the z-axis is implemented.
- Shifting of Curve by a particular distance is implemented.
- At any point of time, you can add or remove a point from the screen.
